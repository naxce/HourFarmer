# 💙 HourFarmer

**HourFarmer** is a lightweight tool designed to **farm Steam in-game hours** by simulating game activity without actively playing.  
It allows selected games to appear as running on your Steam account, increasing their total playtime automatically without the need to run the game (and drain your device's performance).
